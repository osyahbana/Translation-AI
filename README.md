# Translation-AI
Neural Nets utilizing LTSM to learn English - French translation. This is part of Udacity's Deep Learning Foundation Nano Degree

## To-do List
1. Train the network using a larger data-sets. Currently the network only recognize approximately 227 words in the English language. I'll do this if my Amazon AWS's code permitting or that I get around to sign up for Google's cloud computing service
2. Train the network using English - Indonesian language pair so I can judge the quality of the translations better
